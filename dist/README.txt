These are the files needed for binary distribution on Windows:

_ctypes.pyd
library.zip
python34.dll
reset_tool.exe

They will be found here after running py2exe (from the parent directory).

Note: Whether you'll get 32-bit or 64-bit executables depends on whether you used 32-bit or 64-bit Python!
